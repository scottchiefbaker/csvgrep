    - The count of lines had an off-by-one error, as it was including
      the header line. Thanks to Scott Baker for catching this.
    - Put the shebang line back to #!perl, as ExtUtils::MakeMaker
      doesn't currently fix "#!/usr/bin/env perl" on installation.
      See https://github.com/Perl-Toolchain-Gang/ExtUtils-MakeMaker/issues/58
